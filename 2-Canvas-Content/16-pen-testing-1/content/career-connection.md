## Ethical Hacking in the Workplace

So you want to join the red team? Most red teamers or ethical hackers come to their roles from various backgrounds in information technology. The key to being a successful ethical hacker is a broad knowledge of IT systems and networks, basic cybersecurity approaches and knowledge of common threat types and attack vectors. In other words, everything you’re learning now in your program is the foundation to a successful career as an ethical hacker. Your interest in cybersecurity and your willingness to learn are also great assets in the field.

Ethical hacking is not an entry level role in cybersecurity. You will have many cyber-focused positions before transitioning to ethical hacking. Exposure to different aspects of cybersecurity and certifications will help you demonstrate to prospective employers that you have what it takes. After you have obtained your ComTIA Security+ certification, consider the [CompTIA PenTest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) or the [Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) certifications  to strengthen your candidacy for ethical hacking opportunities. Remember that certifications are not always required to secure cybersecurity roles but they do help set you apart from other candidates. 

## Finding Your Career Fit: Level Up Your Interview Skills with S.T.A.R.

The S.T.A.R. interview method is an interview strategy that every job-seeker should know. Our conversations with industry professionals, boot camp alumni, and hiring managers continue to confirm that S.T.A.R. is the best way to structure responses to interview questions like the two listed below.

* Describe a time when you had to deal with a conflict in the workplace.

* Provide an example of a time that you showed leadership.

So, what is S.T.A.R.? It’s a framework for building responses to interview questions. It ensures that your responses are easy-to-follow, fully address the interviewer’s question, and highlight your valuable skills. Here’s the framework:

![Situation: Set the scene for the listener by sharing the context of the situation that you are about to discuss. This could include your role, key stakeholders, or work environment. Task: Describe the problem or challenge that you faced. Examples include meeting a deadline, impressing a client, or solving a technical problem. Action: Explain how you solved the problem or overcame the challenge. This is your time to shine! Highlight the key skills that you leveraged in the scenario. The interviewer will use your response to get an idea of how you would perform at their company. Result: End your story with success by describing your achievements. If possible, use quantitative data to back up your results.](https://static.bc-edx.com/career-services/all-vertical-fycf/lesson-15/l15_fycf-image.png)

Now that you know the framework, let’s review an example. The following is a sample S.T.A.R. response to the prompt: “Tell me about a time when you made a mistake at work.”

_“Two years ago, I worked as a personal trainer at a local gym. The owners learned that I was good with technology, so I started to manage and edit their website. While doing edits, I mistakenly published the wrong address on the website. We had about five clients call in and miss their appointments before I realized what the problem was. Of course, I immediately corrected the mistake on the website. Before we realized what the problem was, we thought that clients were typing in the wrong address, so I also added a Google Maps plugin in order to hopefully bypass that problem. Additionally, I provided anyone impacted by the mistake with a one-month discount. I learned from that experience how important a quality assurance process is. After this situation, I started requesting reviews whenever I made serious changes to the site.”_

This short response taught us a lot about the interviewee’s value. We know their peers see them as good at tech, caring about their clients, learning from their mistakes, and being creative problem solvers. This is a much better response than a simple, “Yes, one time I published the wrong address on a website.”
Now it’s your turn. Preparing and practicing is the best way to learn how to give a S.T.A.R. response. Consider writing a few S.T.A.R. responses when you prepare for interviews.

**Pro Tip:** S.T.A.R. can also be used for networking! S.T.A.R. is a great way to tell concise stories that highlight your value. Use S.T.A.R. to tell stories about your experiences when engaging in networking opportunities.

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interview. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.
>
> 1. Explain how data is protected during and after penetration testing.
>
>Before commencing a penetration test, all the data associated with the software must be carefully backed up because the test can affect the data to prove the software’s vulnerability. Protecting data is a priority before, during, and also after penetration testing. Data can be backed up by either storing copies in the cloud or directly into an external secure hard drive or setting up private encryption. The idea is to have a replacement for your data in case of any damage.
>
> 2. Can you give me some examples of real-world attacks that have been carried out using offensive security methods?
>
>This type of question is designed to test your knowledge of the cybersecurity industry. It is also an opportunity to wow the interviewer with how well you stay up-to-date with cybersecurity news. Here is a sample answer: _There are many examples of real-world attacks that have been carried out using offensive security methods. One well-known example is the Stuxnet attack, which was a targeted attack against Iranian nuclear facilities. The attackers used a variety of methods, including social engineering and malware, to gain access to the facilities and then sabotage the equipment.
>
> Other examples of attacks that have used offensive security methods include the Target breach, in which attackers used malware to gain access to the company’s systems, and the Sony Pictures hack, in which attackers used a combination of social engineering and malware to gain access to the company’s systems and steal sensitive data._

## Next Steps
* If you are actively job-seeking, practice using the S.T.A.R. method to answer common interview questions.
