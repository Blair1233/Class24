## Cloud Computing in the Workplace

Cloud computing in the workplace is changing the way business is done; the projected growth of cloud computing is staggering. Companies are desperately trying to attract and retain people with cloud experience. Pluralsight, a technology workforce development company, reported in their [2023 Tech Forecast](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/teams/top-tech-trends-2023) that there is a huge skill gap between tech leaders who want to develop in the cloud (75%) and technologists who have the experience to do it (8%). This means that there are many opportunities in the cloud computing space but few people who can actually do the work.

What that means for you: As the cloud computing market continues to grow, there will be a huge need for cloud security professionals. So, you are in a good position if you are interested in exploring cloud security jobs. Continue to learn and strengthen your cybersecurity skills. In addition to the CompTIA Security+ certification, consider the ComTIA Cloud+ as a measure to increase your knowledge of cloud computing. Both certifications will give you a competitive advantage when you start applying for cybersecurity jobs. Lastly, network! Network, make friends, talk to people, keep in touch with your coursemates. Your networking efforts will definitely make a huge difference in your career success.

Networking is for all: introverts, extroverts, those with a decade of experience in the industry, and  those who are new to the workplace. It is a unique opportunity to get the inside scoop from the source. Surrounding yourself with the right networking channel can open doors for you, even if you aren’t actively looking.

> 2. What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?
>
>Scalability is the ability to add, remove, or reconfigure hardware and software resources to handle an increase or decrease in usage. Elasticity is automatically scaling up or down resources to meet user demands. The key difference between scalability and elasticity is the level of automation. Scalability requires manual intervention, while elasticity is completely automated. This means scalability requires more effort to manage resources, while elasticity can scale with minimal effort.
