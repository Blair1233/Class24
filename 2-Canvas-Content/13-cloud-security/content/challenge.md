# Module 13 Challenge

## Module 13 Challenge <assignment>

### Cloud Security

Over the last week, you created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training. Now, your lead cloud administrator has asked for a diagram of the Network that you created to keep for documentation and company records. Your task is to use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a detailed diagram of your cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Recap

Once you've completed all of the cloud week activities, you should have:

- A at least two VMs running DVWA.

- All DVWA VMs are receiving traffic from your load balancer.

You can complete this assignment with either two or three VMs.

### Your Goal

When you are finished with this assignment, you should have a network diagram that shows your entire cloud setup, including your Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM.

You can use this document as part of a portfolio to demonstrate your ability.

### Instructions

Use a free account at [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to diagram the entire cloud network that you created this week.

- Your diagram should show the following:
    - Azure resource group
    - Virtual network with IP address range
    - Subnet range
    - Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
    - Security group blocking traffic
    - Load balancer
    - All VMs that you have launched including host names and IP addresses (internal and external where applicable)
    - Where Docker and Ansible are deployed
