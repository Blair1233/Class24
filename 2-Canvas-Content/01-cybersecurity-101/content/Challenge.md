### Security Reporting

Congratulations on completing the first week of your cybersecurity program!
 
We covered *a lot* this week, especially in the security activities. You may wonder: How do security professionals stay informed and current on the threats, defenses, and InfoSec information necessary to remain effective in the field? They read and stay up to date on prominent reports, blogs, and research papers.
 
* In your first Challenge assignment, you will read through three prominent security reports and answer questions in order to get a basic understanding of the market. These reports contain a lot of information, and some of the language might seem esoteric.
 
* The goal of this assignment is for you to get exposure to and learn how to navigate these reports. This is a critical skill.
 
* This assignment is report-heavy, but know that research and reporting are extremely important to the work of a cybersecurity professional.
 
* You will additionally fill out a worksheet while reading through these papers. This worksheet should guide your attention while reading the reports and help you understand the research.
