# Career Connection

**Congratulations on reaching the final portion of your boot camp!**

Over the past several weeks, you’ve participated in an exciting learning journey. This boot camp experience likely had its ups and downs, with both intense learning and “aha” moments when something clicks and you feel great about what you’re working on.

Before you go, we want to remind you of the career services available to you. Many of them continue to be available post-graduation!

![Screenshot of diagram showing the career services available to you. There are five areas of service: Career Engagement Network (CEN), Career Events, Career Material Reviews, Career Coaching and Advising, and Self-Guided Career Course. Detailed information about the service offerings can be found in the content below.](https://static.bc-edx.com/career-services/all-vertical-fycf/lesson-01/l1_fycf_image.png)

## Career Engagement Network

You can visit the Career Engagement Network (CEN) for an unlimited time. We’ve built the CEN to include resources to support you in each stage of your career journey. Some resources on the CEN include an active job board, online events, sample application materials tailored to your industry, interview prep toolkits, and industry insight reports. Explore the CEN at [https://careernetwork.2u.com/](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).

## Workshops & Industry Events

Online events are available to you for an unlimited time. Online events include recruiting events, workshops, networking opportunities, alumni panels, and more. Check out all the [event opportunities here](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/).

## Career Material Review

Career Material Review is available to you for a limited time post-graduation. We highly recommend using this service for your resume and LinkedIn profile. Submit your materials via the Career Services tab in the course portal.

## Career Coaching

Your career team will  help you with all stages of your career journey, including the job search, interview prep, salary negotiation, first days on the job, promotions, and more. To  make the most of the career support, you can meet for personalized coaching sessions where feedback and advice will be available to you. If you have not connected with your career team via the career services email you received earlier in the course, feel free to email the career team at [cssupport@bootcampspot.com](cssupport@bootcampspot.com).

## CEN Plus

[CEN Plus](https://bit.ly/CENPlus), your self-guided career course, is available as long as you have access to the course portal. All of the course content is open, which means that you can choose to go through the course content sequentially or skip to modules that make the most sense for where you are in your career search.

The career services resources are here to support you throughout your entire career, not just during the boot camp. We hope you will continue to use the resources available post-graduation, and we look forward to hearing stories of your success and positive impact in your field.
