## Threat Modeling in the Workplace

This week, you got a crash course on governance, risk, and compliance or GRC. A significant component of GRC is risk management and threat modeling. Threat modeling allows organizations to anticipate who is likely to launch a security attack and the actions that can be taken to prevent them. You learned about three of the most widely used threat model methodologies – PASTA, STRIDE, and OWASP. However, there are several others that you may encounter in the workplace. Here are a few threat modeling methodologies that you may encounter:

* **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** captures a vulnerability’s principal characteristics and produces a numerical severity score. It is often combined with other threat modeling methods.

* **Attack Trees** are one of the oldest and most widely applied methods to model threats and are often combined with other frameworks like STRIDE, PASTA, and CVSS. It’s basically a diagram that depicts attacks on a system in tree form. The root is the goal for the attack, and the leaves are ways to achieve that goal.

* **Trike** is an open-source threat modeling and risk evaluation tool and framework that focuses on privilege escalation and denial of service. It identifies threats from a defensive perspective by modeling the protected system and identifying who can read, create, edit, or delete each entity.

Of course, there are many other threat modeling frameworks out there! As long as you continue to build on the foundational skills you’re gaining in this course, you will ensure that your professional resume is trending in the direction of the workforce. 


## Finding Your Career Fit: Discover Your Strengths

You are embarking on an important journey to start or change your career. First, take a moment to feel good about the step you’ve taken to join the boot camp. You are learning skills that will take your career to the next level. Congratulations on this huge first step!

Take a step back, get to know yourself, and understand your wants and needs. To do this, we’re going to guide you in an assessment of your interests, skills, and values. Understanding these three things will help you make sense of the broad array of career choices. 

The guide linked below will  help you assess what’s important to you. Think of it as a tool to help you identify your new career path. It will help you think about what you want and need so that you can quickly narrow your job search options to opportunities that fit your goals. 

Before you get started, grab some water, tea, or coffee, find a quiet place to reflect, and prepare to spend some time digging deep.

> **Interview Prep**
> 
>Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interview. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.
>
> 1. How does threat modeling help identify vulnerabilities in a system that may not be obvious otherwise?
>
> Threat modeling helps to identify potential vulnerabilities in a system by identifying potential threats and then assessing the system’s ability to defend against those threats. By identifying potential vulnerabilities, threat modeling can help to prevent attacks before they happen.
>
> 2. Why do we need to use a framework like STRIDE while developing threat models?
>
> STRIDE is a mnemonic acronym for the six most common types of attacks that can be carried out against a system: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. By using a framework like STRIDE, we can more easily identify potential threats and develop countermeasures to protect our systems.
