## Communication in the Workplace

Did you know that oral and written communication are vitally important to your career in the cybersecurity field? Lately, you have been learning about penetration testing reports. The ability to write and orally communicate solid pen testing reports is an important skill. In many cases the reports are written and presented for non-technical, decision-makers who allocate funds to remediations. For this reason, communicating complex technical information in an easy-to-understand format is essential.

Professionals, in every industry, who are good at communicating stand out and get things done quicker. As a cybersecurity professional, make it your mission to hone your communication skills. Practice talking tech with non-technical professionals or friends and family to ensure your communication is succinct and easy to understand. This will not only improve the effectiveness of your communication overall, it will also help you master employment interviews, improve your professional relationships and help you stand out in your future roles.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Navigate Career Pivots & Gaps

Employment gaps and career pivots are a normal part of everyone’s career progression. As you hone your new technical skills and get ready to enter a new strategic job search, it is important to consider how you want to present gaps in employment and career shifts.

**Step 1 - Own it!**
The best thing you can do to present yourself confidently and competently is to speak honestly about your career gaps or pivots. Own it! Perhaps you took time to complete a technical boot camp, were laid off, or simply needed a break to reflect on what you wanted to do next. Whatever the reason, own it, talk about it, and put a positive spin on the circumstance because you are here now and ready to add value to your new team.

**Step 2 - Recognize your transferable skills.**
Transferable skills are those soft and hard skills you have developed over time in your previous work. Everyone has transferable skills! Any skill can be transferable depending on what you want to do and what employers are looking for. Identify your transferable skills and bring them into the conversation with employers.

**Step 3 - Anticipate the questions and get prepared.**
Since you know that you have employment gaps or that employers will ask about your career pivot, you can prepare for those questions by developing and practicing what you want to say. Prepare to talk about your employment gaps. Prepare to talk about why you are making a career change. Keep your responses concise and positive, and remind the employer why you’re the best person for the opportunity you’re seeking.

For more guidance on owning and talking about your employment gaps or career pivots with employers, plan to attend the Real Talk: Employment Gaps or the Career Switchers webinar.

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interview. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.
>
> 1. What are the different penetration test phases?
>
>The five phases in pentesting are reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post exploitation and reporting. The first phase is where you obtain publicly available information about your target. Scanning uses tools to identify vulnerabilities and ways to hack into a target. Exploitation and post exploitation means breaching or hacking the target, then extracting data from the compromised target. Reporting provides a summary of actions taken, findings, and recommended security risk mitigations.
>
> 2. Discuss a recent penetration testing project you worked on.
>
>To answer this question, rely on your course projects where you or teammates performed a penetration test. Be sure to mention your approach, which tools you used, the vulnerabilities you found, and the recommendations you made to fix those issues. If you did not work on a pen test project during the course, you can mention similar personal projects, hackathons or hack the box projects that you participated in. The key to answering this question is to share hands-on experience in pen testing that is relevant to the interviewer.

## Next Steps
* Start developing the story you want to share about your career pivot or employment gaps.
