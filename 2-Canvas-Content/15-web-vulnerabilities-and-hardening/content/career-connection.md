## OWASP  in the Workplace

This week you utilized an incredibly popular resource in the cybersecurity industry, the [OWASP Top Ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). OWASP is a community-driven organization dedicated to improving the security of software and applications through the promotion of open standards, tools, and best practices. Although the Top Ten list is the most popular resource published by OWASP, there are several other OWASP resources that you can utilize in the workplace.

Here are three other helpful resources that the OWASP community provides:

* Web application testing: OWASP offers a range of free and open-source tools for testing web applications, such as the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), which can help identify vulnerabilities in web applications and provide guidance on how to fix them.
* Security standards and guidelines: OWASP contributes to the development of security standards and guidelines, such as the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) and the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF), which provide detailed guidance on how to build and test secure applications.
* Community collaboration: OWASP encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among cybersecurity professionals. Through participation in OWASP community events and initiatives, cybersecurity professionals can connect with peers and learn from one another's experiences.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Prepare for Your Interview

Preparing for an interview is vital to successfully moving forward through the hiring process. Here are some quick tips on how to prepare:

**Do your research.**
Learn about the employer, job, and people interviewing you. All of this information will help you prepare and tailor responses during the interview. If you don’t know who will be interviewing you, ask! An HR representative will often be happy to provide you with the name and role of the person interviewing you.

**Prepare for the most commonly asked interview questions.**
These questions will likely come up. Be prepared to respond to them. FYI, the most common interview question is, “Can you tell me more about yourself?”

**Anticipate tough interview questions.**
At least one question will catch you by surprise. Doing mock interviews with your career coach or peers can help you prepare for this.

**Prepare for salary conversations.**
Salary will likely come up in the hiring process. Know your value before going into the interview.

**Plan to make a great first impression.**
First impressions are important, so arrive early, ensure a quiet and distraction-free environment, and dress appropriately.

**Develop tailored questions.**
You will have time to ask questions at the end of the interview. Come prepared with questions specific to the company and role.

Check out the [Career Connection Resource Library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiuZP_ZYMiIopqS0pFWUji58ESASMQUl2CQJphReaGo/edit?usp=sharing) to better prepare for the interview. It contains interview prep guides and links to relevant workshops. 

> **Interview Prep**
>Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interview. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.
>
> 1. Can you walk me through a specific instance where you used OWASP resources or tools to identify and remediate a security vulnerability in a web application? 
>
>If you are new to the industry, your response may include activities from this module. Remember that the activities and projects in this course count as experience. Employers are interested to hear about your accomplishments in both professional and educational settings. 
>
> 2. How would you balance the need for security with the need for usability and functionality in a web application, and how can OWASP help in this regard? 
>
>Answers to this question will vary. You could mention how the OWASP Top Ten helps cybersecurity professionals determine which security features must be prioritized. If possible, include a story about when you were faced with the dilemma proposed in this question.

## Next Steps
* If you are actively job searching, get a head start on your interview preparation by meeting with your career team.
