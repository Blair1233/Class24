Cybersecurity Paths in the Workplace

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of [roles for information security analysts will grow 35 percent](https://www.bls.gov/OOH/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm#tab-6) between 2021 and 2031. Roughly 19,500 cybersecurity jobs will be added to the American job market each year over that period. This means you are positioning yourself well to grow within the industry.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Ask for a Raise or Promotion

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interviews. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.
>
> 1. How would you monitor our Splunk infrastructure? Give a few examples of a critical issue and how you would resolve it.
>
> This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your research on the company. Feel free to ask follow-up questions to understand their technical infrastructure better. To describe how you would monitor the system and handle critical issues, we recommend using the STAR  method. STAR involves explaining the situation, task, action, and result of your actions. For this particular question, your results should focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of your actions. 
>
> 2. How do you handle security incidents not detected by the SIEM system?
>
> This can be a tricky question, and it is designed to test your knowledge of SIEM systems. Begin by acknowledging that it's not uncommon for security incidents to go undetected by the SIEM system. Explain that despite its effectiveness, no security solution is foolproof, and new or sophisticated attacks can sometimes evade detection. Highlight the importance of proactive security measures to complement the SIEM system, and feel free to name a few. To wrap up your answer to this question, outline your approach to incident response for security incidents that elude the SIEM system.

## Next Steps
* Collect your accomplishments from previous experiences on the brag sheet.
