* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

## Terminal  in the Workplace

If you are new to Terminal, working with the command line interface (CLI) may feel a bit clunky compared to the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that most people are familiar with. Throughout this course, you will improve your CLI skills, and it is essential that you do because most cybersecurity professionals use the CLI on a daily basis. The CLI is a foundational cybersecurity skill because it allows us to concisely express an intent while accounting for the small details. This skill is so foundational that you won’t see it in job descriptions; employers assume that you know how to utilize the CLI because it is the most efficient way to perform tasks.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Discover Your Pathway

One of the most exciting parts of this program is the versatility of your new skills. They pave the path to multiple career options. For example, your next goal may be a management role, a consulting role, or a specialist role. There are so many options, and you are still early in the program, so we recommend exploring a wide range of career opportunities.
