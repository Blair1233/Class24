## Streamlining Communication in the Workplace

Security is essential to every application, but it can often get shuffled to the back of a project to-do list. To software developers, security can sometimes seem like a hassle or a roadblock. These issues are solved through streamlined communication and collaboration.

Cybersecurity teams and software developers must be able to work together effectively. Each team understands the other, but they don’t speak the same language and don’t always have the exact same goals for success. Luckily, you are gaining a wealth of web and software development knowledge. With your newfound ability to speak the language of developers, you are on a path that will significantly improve your ability to communicate cross-functionally. Continue to grow your web and software development knowledge, as it will ensure you are a top candidate for cybersecurity roles.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Write Your Personal Brand Summary

In a previous Career Connection, we discussed how storytelling could help you stand out in the hiring process. Today, let’s review a powerful storytelling tool: the personal brand summary.

A personal brand summary is a one- to five-sentence paragraph summarizing  your experience, skills, and interests. It’s usually placed at the top of a resume, portfolio, or profile and therefore serves as a first impression of a job candidate. So, your brand statement should be a glowing summary of your value as an employee.

Let’s review an example. The following resume brand statement is for an entry-level professional in the cybersecurity industry.

> _Detail-oriented Security Analyst experienced in online security research, planning, execution, and maintenance. Certificate in cybersecurity from [enter school name], with a background in training and educating internal users on relevant security procedures and preventative measures. More than 4 years’ experience with Python and Bash scripting, Linux, Windows, and Kali Linux, with CompTIA certifications in Security+ and Linux+. Critical thinker, specializing in network monitoring, security software installation, and working to prevent cyberattacks in corporate settings. Passionate about security and driven to stay up to date on the latest trends and tools in the InfoSec community._ 
This brand statement is only five sentences, but it tells us so much about the applicant. We know that they have experience educating users, are skilled in network monitoring and preventing cyber attacks. We also know that they can use Python and Bash scripting and Kali Linux. This applicant has given us a glowing review of their value as an employee. Now it’s your turn to do the same.
Here are our top tips for building your brand summary:

* **Be concise.** Aim for 75-150 words. Keep it focused and make every line count.

* **Position yourself as a professional.** The first line in your summary should present you with the job title of your desired role. Avoid identifying as a student; instead, identify as a professional.

* **Highlight your most relevant education, skills, and experience.** Reflect on your career experience and education. Then choose the points that are most relevant to your career goals. Every sentence in your summary should show the employer that you are a qualified candidate.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Prepare for your cybersecurity interviews! Use the following questions to test your knowledge and prepare for your cybersecurity interview. Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and compare your responses to the suggestion provided.

> _There are several advantages and disadvantages of using cookies. Some advantages include: cookies are simple to use and implement, they occupy less memory and do not require server resources, and they can be configured to persist for a specific length of time. Some disadvantages include: cookies are not very secure, there are limitations on the size of cookie text and number of cookies, and users can delete or disable cookies._
>
> When answering this question, it is not important that you know ALL of the advantages and disadvantages. What is important, is that you demonstrate your knowledge of cookies and how they impact your work to secure an organization’s network. 
>
> 2. What are some common risks associated with cookies?
>
> For the most part, cookies are completely safe. Of course, like anything on the internet, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities. Some common risks associated with cookies are:
>
> * **Cross-site request forgery attack (XSRF)** - Cookies are neutral and websites cannot distinguish an actual user from an attacker. This _cookie neutrality_ is something attackers can take advantage of to initiate a malicious action.
> * **Session Fixation** - When visiting different websites, your computer stores session cookies for as long as your browser is open. That way, you won’t have to log in every time you visit a new page on the site. While efficient for the user, it can allow attackers to hijack your legitimate session ID.
> * **Cookie Tossing Attack** - Some websites use unsecured cookies without a path or domain name. So, if there’s more than one cookie, the browser will randomly pick which one to use. Attackers are finding ways to use this loophole to break into user accounts.
>
> Of course there are other risks associated with cookies, but these are just a few. _**Note:** Familiarize yourself with other risks associated with cookies. Be prepared to answer questions and discuss each one in detail._
